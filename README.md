# 📈 Stock Analysis Dashboard Project
I'm excited to share my latest data analysis project: an interactive Stock Analysis Dashboard! This project demonstrates my skills in data processing, analysis, and visualization using a powerful combination of SQL, Python, and Microsoft Excel.

📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze historical stock data for several major tech companies (AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, NFLX) and visualize key metrics in a clear, concise, and interactive dashboard.

Key Metrics & Insights Visualized:
Market Adjusted Close Price: Tracking monthly price movements.

Average Daily Return: Understanding the volatility and typical performance.

Maximum Open Price by Ticker: Identifying peak daily opening values.

Sum of Daily Return by Ticker: Highlighting overall proportional returns contribution.

Monthly Volume of Company: Analyzing trading liquidity and investor interest.

Monthly Price Range: Showing the spread between high and low prices for the month.

Scatter Plot of Daily Return vs. Volume: Exploring the relationship between trading activity and returns.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies
This project utilized a complete data pipeline, from raw data to final visualization:

1. Data Preparation & Cleaning (Microsoft Excel):

Initial data review, cleaning, and basic transformation of raw CSV files.

Ensuring data consistency and handling basic missing values.

2. Data Processing & Feature Engineering (Python):

Used Pandas to load, manipulate, and calculate advanced metrics (e.g., daily returns, monthly ranges, and adjusted close prices).

Automated data transformation workflows for efficiency.

3. Data Storage & Querying (SQL):

The cleaned and processed data was loaded into an SQL database (e.g., SQLite/PostgreSQL) to simulate a real-world data environment.

Wrote complex SQL queries to aggregate, filter, and prepare specific datasets needed for the final visualizations, showcasing proficiency in data retrieval and relational database management.

4. Visualization (Dashboard Software):

The final dashboard was created by connecting to the processed data source and building the various charts and graphs shown in the image beelow .

✨ Learnings and Takeaways
This project reinforced my ability to manage a full data lifecycle: starting with raw data, performing robust processing and engineering in Python and SQL, and culminating in a highly informative and engaging business intelligence dashboard. It was a great exercise in translating complex financial data into actionable visual insights.
